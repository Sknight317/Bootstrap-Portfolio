                                    <p>Hi, my name is Savannah Knight. I currently reside in the Orlando area and am the mother of a 4 year old daughter. I am a registered nurse who is serious about making a career change and breaking into the industry of 
                                            web development. I have completed my Associate in Science degree in Nursing at Valencia College. I am also a few classes away from completing my
                                            Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing from the University of Central Florida. I am currently attending a Coding Bootcamp through UCF's continuing education services.
                                            I intend to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful as a full stack web developer and am putting forth my best effort to do so.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-12">
                                    <p>My experience as a registered nurse has allowed me to gain valuable skills that can be transferred to the field of web development.
                                            Working with critical care pediatric patients has allowed me to become extremely organized, vigilant, and meticulous. 
                                            Being a nurse also allowed me to master effective time management, the ability to multitask, and work cohesively as part of a team. </p>
                                    <p>I am extremely pasionate about web development, and am always looking to improve myself. I look forward to making my dreams a reality. </p>

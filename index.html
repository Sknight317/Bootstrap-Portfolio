                                            web development. I have completed my Associate in Science degree in Nursing at Valencia College. I am also a few classes away from completing my
                                            Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing from the University of Central Florida. I am currently attending a Coding Bootcamp through UCF's continuing education services.
                                            I intend to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful as a full stack web developer and am putting forth my best effort to do so.</p>

                                            Working with critical care pediatric patients has allowed me to become extremely organized, vigilant, and meticulous. 
                                            Being a nurse also allowed me to master effective time management, the ability to multitask, and work cohesively as part of a team. </p>
